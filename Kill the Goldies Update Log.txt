1.0.0 - Original Release
I made the game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well not really 'today' as it could imply I'm not some sort of god or machine you get me
Okay so backstory for the game this is very important okay so I found this project from school and rebranded it around Golden Freddy because it was funny to share with friends xDDDDDDD

2.0.0 - GAME'S AWESOME NOW
Ended thinking "it'd be really fun to make a weird semi-complex game with Freddy variants instead" and knowing me and my love for FNaF you know I had to do it :-))))))))
I also thought it'd be funny to make it so after a certain amount of points you entered an Enderking fight BECAUSE IT IS
Get more than 100 points, fight Enderking!!
Voice acted by Sleek Enderking has like 5 attacks and like 13 points of health AND YOU HAVE 3 LOLLLLLLL
It's made to be like a hard fight and shid you get me you may need to try a good amount of times before you can actually defeat him ;)))))) I don't beat around the bush.
alright that was a good update im gonna work on a custom night or whatever my FOLLOWERS NEED ME!!!!
