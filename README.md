Kill the Goldies plz :..(

Scratch release of the game (only normal mode, endless is gamejolt exclusive lol)

Welcome to the main war-zone against the Goldies.

As you probably know, the Goldies have been coming from their world to ours, destroying everything on their path. You are one of the last remaining survivors from said invasion, and you must take them down.

Arm yourself with your trusty sniper and shoot down their defenses. Depending on which you kill and how fast, you may attract more or less attention from the leading forces of the opposite war...

And please, do as fast as possible. We only have 15 seconds before their leader arrives. And if he sets his eyes on you... We may need to bid you an early retirement.

Set exactly 10 days after normal mode, and with Him defeated, it seems as if the forces of the opposite team have set their eyes on brand new and mysterious technology that allows to clone themselves. This is bad- no, horrible news.

To counteract this, we have spent the last 13 minutes working on a prototype robot. But it's not quite finished... His Auto-Recharging Battery seems to not fully work and his aim hasn't been automized. But there's no time to fix those errors.

The Goldies are leaking and FAST. We need you to use this prototype and hold them for the time being... But don't let the battery reach 0, or the robot will turn off... And god only knows what will happen when it does.
